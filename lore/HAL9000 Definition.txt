HAL (for Heuristically programmed ALgoritmic computer, no less) was a masterwork
of the third computer breakthrough. These seemed to occur at intervals of twenty
years, and the thought that another one was now immiment already worried a great
many people. 

The first had been in the 1940s, when the long-obsolete vaccum tube had made 
possible such clumsy, high speed morons as ENIAC and its successors. Then, in 
the 1960s, solid-state microelectronics had been perfected. With its advent, it 
was clear that artificial intelligences at least as powerful as Man's need be no
larger than office desks - if one only knew how to construct them. 

Probably no one would ever know this; it did not matter. In the 1980s, Minsky 
and Good have shown how neural networks could be generated automatically - self-
replicated - in accordance with an arbitrary learning program. Artificial brains
could be grown by a process strikingly analogous to the development of a human 
brain. In any given case, the precise details would never be known, and even if 
they were, they would be millions of times too complex for human understanding. 

Whatever way it worked, the final result was a machine intelligence that could 
reproduce - some philosophers still preferred to use the word "mimic" - most of
the activities of the human brain, and with far greater speed and reliability. 
It was extremelly expensive, and only a few units of the HAL 9000 series had yet
been built;  but the old jest that it would always be easier to make organic 
brains by unskilled labor was beginning to sound a litte hollow.
